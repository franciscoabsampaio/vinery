**vineyard** is an [infrastructure-as-code](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) framework that leverages opinionated, plug-and-play Terraform/OpenTofu
plans to programmatically generate data and analytics infrastructure in Azure.

**vineyard**'s value proposition comes in two parts:

- A library üìö of plans for managing Azure infrastructure for data and analytics, that is:

  - **Opinionated:** sensible choices are made for each resource, to minimize the configuration chaos that IaC can become.
  - **Plug-and-play:** each plan is designed to provide unique, but complementary, components to the infrastructure. Plans have dependencies, and expect certain components, generated by parent plans, to

- The **vine** üçÉ CLI, responsible for parsing through each plan's dependencies, builds the project's plan dependency graph, and batch execution of Terraform/OpenTofu commands on the selected plans.

You simply choose which components to include from the library - **vine** determines the required dependencies, and executes everything in sequence - allowing you (or your CI) to sit back and pour some of your vineyard's best grape juice. üç∑

## Pre-Requisites & Disclaimers

The **vine** CLI expects [OpenTofu CLI](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)/[Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli), as well as [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt) to be installed.

**vineyard** expects no different settings or configurations than how you would normally configure the Azure provider. However, our default plans **do not** support inline configuration of provider credentials, since we don't recommend it ourselves.

## Getting Started



## Library

The library houses the plans for setting up the vineyard. Whether you take from the default library or build your own plans is up to you! 

### Creating new plans

Creating a new plan is just as normal as any other IaC workflow. Just add a [`_deps.conf` file to the plan root, and fill in with the required dependencies](./docs/dependency_configuration.md).

By default, **vine** expects the library to be located in a `library` directory, but this can be configured.

### Default plans

Currently, the default library consists of the following plans:

## This repository supports OpenTofu and Terraform

This project was tested on:

- OpenTofu 1.9.0.
- Terraform 1.6.0.

Both are great options, but [we prefer OpenTofu](./docs/opentofu-vs-terraform.md).

## Known Bugs / Issues

- Changing an existing Databricks Workspace's `public_network_access_enabled` parameter via the `private_frontend` input variable (`local.tfvars`) causes the Terraform/Tofu runtime to get stuck in `Still modifying...`. Despite the message, if the execution is interrupted, the change is successful, as re-running the plan yields `Your infrastructure matches the configuration.` and the changes can be shown to have taken effect in the workspace.
